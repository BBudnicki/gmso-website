Dr. VandeWoude is currently on a Fulbright sabbatical studying wildlife disease ecology in Tasmania.","Blurb Author":"EKA","Centroid Mapper":"Mary Williams (2021-2022)","LAT":" ","Story Theme":"Health","Institutional/Program Stories":["recPQTwK0Bc7NsocO","rec0scLExpYcBzVhl"],"Production Round":"Round 1","Grand Challenge":["Infectious Disease"],"Story Assets":["TBD"],"Start date":"2021-07-01","End date":"2021-10-01","Career Pathway ":["Veterinarian","Virologist "],"SharePoint Folder":"https://colostate.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/CAS_Global_Mapping_and_Strategic_Outreach/EhE_UDsdjvFMkrjcBZWTjwABvlQqz_zg31jBTV60cBmKcQ?e=eFKuMG","StoryMap VIEW Link":"https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/1ae6356047b143ae927111e9e4f3fed0/edit","Story Card Image":[{"id":"attnJBsPsjETZyMMK","width":6000,"height":3375,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/fcdb726c505759c243af3ccb477d397b/750cb545/nataliya-smirnova-rayvpOMVwJM-unsplash1.jpg","filename":"nataliya-smirnova-rayvpOMVwJM-unsplash (1).jpg","size":2852397,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/c2838390f648baad813f926152f9783e/215d72d0","width":64,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/16825574e593a2fa8b73f608ca77208c/d4e41cdc","width":910,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/9e9b4b88bda667997d60ae67cc41c87d/4a9cf9a8","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Pop-Up Card Content":"All cats — domestic and wild — can become infected with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), resulting in a disease process comparable to HIV in humans.
