With fewer protections, more pollutants can be washed downstream — but some streams classified as ephemeral may actually be intermittent or seasonal, which would qualify them for protection. That’s where CSU professor Dr. Stephanie Kampf comes in. Dr. Kampf has been working for four years to map and define small headwater streams.
