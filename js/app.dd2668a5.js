In Burkina Faso, nearly every single person has malaria parasites in his or her system during the rainy season, and children can get the disease repeatedly before they develop immunity. Dr. Brian Foy, a professor in the Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Pathology at CSU, found that the use of Ivermectin, typically used to treat parasitic worms, led to a significant reduction in cases of malaria among children under the age of five. While Ivermectin has been known to kill blood feeding insects like mosquitos, Dr. Foy thinks it may also have an effect on the malaria parasite inside the body. If he\'s right, the findings could have implications for communities and inviduals across West Africa.","Blurb Author":"JF","Centroid Mapper":"Mary Williams (2021-2022)","LAT":"12.933333","LONG":"0.000000","Story Theme":"Health","Institutional/Program Stories":["rec0scLExpYcBzVhl"],"Production Round":"Round 2","en-StoryMapLink":"https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/7377649383dd4ff883502c8e24d19d5f","Story Card Image":[{"id":"attBi9UZAJ0sk289b","width":1920,"height":1080,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/fc3dff794314a777cbe381eb3ec8389a/dde4c4d2/foy.jpg?ts=1651171783&userId=usr4dlUZPXXwaIEys&cs=63e46bc741563f35","filename":"foy.jpg","size":682014,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/de42026dd2b6fa448aa58ff5d15bfd2a/adb05292?ts=1651171783&userId=usr4dlUZPXXwaIEys&cs=78f133ada1101b1c","width":64,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/314105b5b06139a5067ec56ccd4692f7/d2e86e46?ts=1651171783&userId=usr4dlUZPXXwaIEys&cs=63c26e119bc8f7fb","width":910,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/c8ce38da7d3258efbccf92e151429075/56a71dcd?ts=1651171783&userId=usr4dlUZPXXwaIEys&cs=37657f945d6d6f91","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"sp-Tagline":"Blocking transmission of malaria in Burkina Faso","sp-StoryMapLink":"https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/7377649383dd4ff883502c8e24d19d5f/edit","sp-StoryTitle":"Enfermedad correcta.
