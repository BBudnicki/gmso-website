While Ivermectin has been known to kill blood feeding insects like mosquitos, Dr. Foy thinks it may also have an effect on the malaria parasite inside the body. If he\'s right, the findings could have implications for communities and inviduals across West Africa.","Blurb Author":"JF","Centroid Mapper":"Mary Williams (2021-2022)","Story Theme":"Health","Institutional/Program Stories":["rec0scLExpYcBzVhl"],"Production Round":"Round 2"},"createdTime":"2021-08-29T20:38:35.000Z"},{"id":"recFWjqo7qYs1nvRH","fields":{"Last Name":"Fremstad","First Name":"Anders","College/Division":["SOGES"],"Production Round":"Potential Story List"},"createdTime":"2021-09-21T23:26:45.000Z"},{"id":"recisCoiz3zBVujZB","fields":{"Last Name":"Fujisawa","First Name":"Hideyuki","Story Theme":"Int\'l/FG/Alum/Student","ID Tags":["Alumnus"],"Production Round":"Potential Story List","Year":"2002"},"createdTime":"2021-09-02T13:47:01.000Z"},{"id":"receOWuVyh79oVIbJ","fields":{"Last Name":"Funamizu","First Name":"Shuhei","Story Theme":"Int\'l/FG/Alum/Student","ID Tags":["Alumnus"],"Production Round":"Potential Story List","Year":"2007"},"createdTime":"2021-09-02T13:48:05.000Z"},{"id":"reckaI6NwN7FMIUbb","fields":{"Last Name":"Gaines","First Name":"Todd","Institution":"Fort Collins","College/Division":["Agricultural Sciences"],"Unit/Program":["Agricultural Biology"],"Research Focus":"Harnessing Next-Generation Sequencing Technologies for Eco-Evolutionary Studies of Herbicide Resistance and Weed Biology","Spatial Angle":"Herbicide use in the country","Story Theme":"Environment","ID Tags":["Alumnus"],"Institutional/Program Stories":["recQCiv7n0YhrDl65"],"Production Round":"Round 2"},"createdTime":"2021-08-29T20:38:35.000Z"},{"id":"recVWgo81pGpAONfe","fields":{"Last Name":"Galvin","First Name":"Kathleen","StoryMap Link":"https://arcg.is/1DWGSX","Institution":"Fort Collins","College/Division":["Liberal Arts"],"Unit/Program":["Anthropology and Geography"],"Research Focus":"Human Environment Interactions - Kenya","Story Title":"Listening Out For Pastoralism ","Tagline":"Human-Environmental Adaptability, Vulnerability, and Interaction","Research Blurb":"For pastoral people in East Africa, daily life revolves around the herd of animals that sustain them — and the land they travel to make sure the animals have room to graze and grow. As the climate changes, their traditional lifestyles are also changing, from subsistence to greater reliance on local villages for food, health care, and other services. CSU Anthropologist Kathleen Galvin has spent 30 years learning from the people who populate East African savannas. Listening to the Maasai share knowledge of climate change and the challenges it creates in their daily lives, Galvin also brings them together in a conversation with scientists and civil leaders to better understand the real human impacts of climate change on this vulnerable population.","Blurb Author":"CN","Spatial Angle":"Kenya on a map of Africa","LAT":" ","Story Theme":"Environment","ID Tags":["Alumnus"],"Institutional/Program Stories":["rec0scLExpYcBzVhl"],"Production Round":"Round 1","Grand Challenge":["Climate Change"],"Degree":["BA","MA"],"Story Assets":["Video "],"Start date":"2021-07-01","End date":"2021-10-01","SharePoint Folder":"https://colostate.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/CAS_Global_Mapping_and_Strategic_Outreach/EljsFOehMRhNimnglhG1THsBjUBNY9q5s0olmKU5Mwlu9A?e=qd5roL","StoryMap VIEW Link":"https://csurams.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=a9ee32cb6bd4466ab8366aa24fb7da19#"},"createdTime":"2021-08-29T20:38:35.000Z"},{"id":"recRGYcCPAoTX0nxO","fields":{"Last Name":"Gates","First Name":"Tim","Institution":"Fort Collins","College/Division":["Walter Scott, Jr. College of Engineering"],"Unit/Program":["Civil and Environmental Engineering"],"Research Focus":"USAID project in water resources with Pakistan; also USAID projects in Vietnam and Iran","Spatial Angle":"Map of pakistan, map of USAID projects in Pakistan, or map of water in Pakistan","Story Theme":"Water","ID Tags":["Alumnus"],"Production Round":"Round 2"},"createdTime":"2021-08-29T20:38:35.000Z"},{"id":"recToCzZOzKmczzzz","fields":{"Last Name":"Gavin","First Name":"Michael","College/Division":["Warner College of Natural Resources"],"Unit/Program":["Department of Human Dimensions of Natural Resources"],"Research Focus":"International Biological and Cultural Diversity","Production Round":"Potential Story List"},"createdTime":"2021-09-21T23:26:45.000Z"},{"id":"recTDHu7ObjpdpjYX","fields":{"Last Name":"Gentry-Weeks","First Name":"Claudia","College/Division":["CVMBS"],"Production Round":"Potential Story List"},"createdTime":"2021-09-21T23:26:45.000Z"},{"id":"rec6Pwnj8sMrMqTWB","fields":{"Last Name":"Glenn","First Name":"Ryan","Story Theme":"Int\'l/FG/Alum/Student","ID Tags":["Alumnus"],"Production Round":"Potential Story List","Year":"2005"},"createdTime":"2021-09-02T13:48:25.000Z"},{"id":"recKqlzDZAQoL6lFV","fields":{"Last Name":"Goodrich","First Name":"Ray","Institution":"Fort Collins","College/Division":["Office of the Vice President for Research (OVPR)"],"Story Theme":"Health","Institutional/Program Stories":["recSYo8jT63xCEEGY"],"Production Round":"Round 2"},"createdTime":"2021-08-29T20:38:35.000Z"},{"id":"recuOlZBYTAfovTGs","fields":{"Last Name":"Graff","First Name":"Gregory","College/Division":["College of Agricultural Sciences"],"Unit/Program":["Agricultural and Resource Economics"],"Research Focus":"Taught and advised students in the Chalmers School of Entrepreneurship masters programs.

With fewer protections, more pollutants can be washed downstream — but some streams classified as ephemeral may actually be intermittent or seasonal, which would qualify them for protection. That’s where CSU professor Dr. Stephanie Kampf comes in. Dr. Kampf has been working for four years to map and define small headwater streams. Kampf and her team recently enlisted the help of the public through the Stream Tracker Project, an app that allows users to collect and submit their own data on nearby waterways.","Blurb Author":"JF","Centroid Mapper":"Amanda Hastings (2021-2022)","Spatial Angle":"Ask researcher for maps of watersheds that they have created (maps mentioned in blurb)","LAT":" ","Story Theme":"Water","Institutional/Program Stories":["recgh0HXJG2zMUgpR"],"Production Round":"Round 1","Story Assets":["Interactive Map","Find Existing Map","Video "],"Start date":"2021-07-01","End date":"2021-10-01","Career Pathway ":["Hydrogeologist "],"SharePoint Folder":"https://colostate.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/CAS_Global_Mapping_and_Strategic_Outreach/EuX6FMniY5xNg_93M04GatEB4tWA4_W7DnTLVsZA6xHqRw?e=lz2hhQ","StoryMap VIEW Link":"https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/e18a8ca2cfd94f2784ea973cb30370f4/edit","Story Card Image":[{"id":"attfJeraJi3N6jQlT","width":7200,"height":4457,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/33e9006b8b57fd3ecf23f88ac1f8c9eb/d3b3dbac/robert-zunikoff-ko7Tp_LyAt4-unsplash1.jpg","filename":"robert-zunikoff-ko7Tp_LyAt4-unsplash (1).jpg","size":5298755,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/77abac895a987ba6b3ff24222f46fd52/0882c5d4","width":58,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/84c14f152cbb9b8fd2d9ae877ab9126d/2f4e8a4e","width":827,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/021c8a60d8855b1916f1f1a2ed41c67d/f585584f","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Pop-Up Card Content":"Under the EPA’s recent Navigable Waters Protection Rule, streams classified as “ephemeral streams” — those which only flow briefly after rain or snowmelt — are not protected under the Clean Water Act.","Pop-Up Card Image":[{"id":"attcZAn6vJBv5pooF","width":478,"height":444,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/10b5dbe9fa74a51f9bd9b9a9f09489b6/67deeb6a/43d1ae_37ed14f450014747b18bb92181eb8a4d_mv2.webp","filename":"43d1ae_37ed14f450014747b18bb92181eb8a4d_mv2.webp","size":228612,"type":"image/webp","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/d2eef8224f298f6a83ea9f74fe698f18/50fe8d22.png","width":39,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/ba9a77928bf31911db114ad44c6ddda9/d2446e40.png","width":478,"height":444},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/c8b6ed3168f8db48a16bda3ad4b333ef/1f4deed9.png","width":3000,"height":3000}}}]},"createdTime":"2021-08-29T20:38:35.000Z"},{"id":"recgnIh6jPL7aZ9nX","fields":{"Last Name":"Katsuhama","First Name":"Yoshihiro","Story Theme":"Int\'l/FG/Alum/Student","ID Tags":["Alumnus"],"Production Round":"Potential Story List","Year":"2010"},"createdTime":"2021-09-02T13:53:53.000Z"},{"id":"rec5eW2jovEacTyy9","fields":{"Last Name":"Kawahara","First Name":"Maki","Story Theme":"Int\'l/FG/Alum/Student","ID Tags":["Alumnus"],"Production Round":"Potential Story List","Year":"2007"},"createdTime":"2021-09-02T13:54:17.000Z"},{"id":"recKbeb3x8O4d2cB3","fields":{"Last Name":"Khosla","First Name":"Rajiv","Institution":"Fort Collins","College/Division":["Agricultural Sciences"],"Unit/Program":["Soil and Crop Sciences"],"Research Focus":"Precision Agriculture in India","Story Title":"Precision Agriculture","Tagline":" Hype or hope?","Research Blurb":"The business of feeding the world today is high-tech — and CSU professor Rajiv Khosla takes that to the next level.

While the exact mechanisms aren\'t fully understood, prions -- misfolded proteins -- cause neurons to degenerate by forming plaques in the central nervous system. As neurons die, holes are formed in the brain and other neural tissue, leading to dramatic weight loss, listlessness, trouble walking, and eventually death. While there has never been a reported case of CWD in humans, a jump to humans is not outside of the realm of possibility. And humans already experience other protein-misfolding diseases such as Alzheimer\'s, Parkinson\'s, and diabetes. CSU\'s Candace Mathiason is a leading researcher in the area of prions -- while working on her Ph.D., she demonstrated for the first time that prions are carried in bodily fluids and can be transmitted without direct bodily contact -- and hopes that her research into mechanisms of transmission can shed light on not just CWD, but a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases.
