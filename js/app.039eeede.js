When people have passion and the power to create change, the cycle of impact is collective ... and collective impact is infinite impact.”\\n\\nChristiana Kennedy wanted to help as many animals as possible, but she knew she couldn’t do it alone. So she started PawsCO, a foster-based animal rescue in Denver, CO, that focuses on supporting the work of rural and urban animal shelters.\\n\\nAll PawsCO animals live in foster homes, rather than shelters, until they are adopted. Today, PawsCO has more than 350 volunteers.\\n\\n“By sharing my passion to help animals with other people, there have been numerous ripples of empowerment: people who become advocates for animals, people who have fostered and welcomed animals in their own homes, people who have become passionate about adoption and have adopted animals, donated resources, and thought differently about the way they interact with animals.”\\n\\nHer love for animals also inspires her work for the Colorado State University System, which offers education in human and animal health.\\n\\n“I like to think of my work as finding challenges and working to solve them in new ways. Whether it\'s thinking about how to best help animals in need and the shelter partners who serve them, or thinking about new ways that our higher education system can serve students and help them feel like college is a path they can chose -- I\'ve been really fortunate in my roles to be able to think about finding ways to connect identified problems with creative and fresh solutions.”\\n\\nTiana and her husband, Matt, enjoy being foster parents and live in Denver with their rescue dog, Poe.\\n\\n“One day when I look back on my life, I hope the answer remains that my greatest impact is on helping people think a little differently. I try to approach situations with compassion and action, and for whatever my career and life throw at me, I hope that will continue to serve others well.”\\n\\n“My education at CSU has been the foundation of all that I do. Learning to be a communicator – my liberal arts education – is by far my most important skill set in my career. No matter what I am doing or which problems I\'m diving into trying to solve, being able to communicate with others about the issue, share ideas, and outline possible solutions is key.”\\n\\nFor Future Research | Para futuras investigaciones\\n\\nLearn all you can.

Dr. Brian Foy, a professor in the Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Pathology at CSU, found that the use of Ivermectin, typically used to treat parasitic worms, led to a significant reduction in cases of malaria among children under the age of five. While Ivermectin has been known to kill blood feeding insects like mosquitos, Dr. Foy thinks it may also have an effect on the malaria parasite inside the body. If he\'s right, the findings could have implications for communities and inviduals across West Africa.","LAT":"12.933333","LONG":"0.000000","Story Theme":"Health","Institutional/Program Stories":["rec0scLExpYcBzVhl"],"Grand Challenge":["Infectious Disease","COVID 19"],"Career Pathway ":["Immunologist"],"en-StoryMapLink":"https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/7377649383dd4ff883502c8e24d19d5f","Story Card Image":[{"id":"attBi9UZAJ0sk289b","width":1920,"height":1080,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/fc3dff794314a777cbe381eb3ec8389a/dde4c4d2/foy.jpg","filename":"foy.jpg","size":682014,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/de42026dd2b6fa448aa58ff5d15bfd2a/adb05292","width":64,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/314105b5b06139a5067ec56ccd4692f7/d2e86e46","width":910,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/c8ce38da7d3258efbccf92e151429075/56a71dcd","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Email":"brian.foy@colostate.edu","es-StoryTitle":"Prevención en la mordedura","QR Code":[{"id":"attxEzLLC3opIbyhg","width":660,"height":660,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/43341f58bedf6dad4eac901a7f30e09a/0b2619b3/QRCode12.png","filename":"QRCode (12).png","size":44025,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/219bbe48d4ce538e8e732c270fd37705/6d1af0c4","width":36,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/f40c2f9860225002f31dfd2cd38facde/28bc6175","width":512,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/dcddf05960186360b0b3096f8fb74ec8/0dd6d764","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Shortened CSU Branded URL":"https://col.st/fyWTt","Bilingual Translation":true,"Status":"Currently at CSU"}},{"id":"recKqlzDZAQoL6lFV","createdTime":"2021-08-29T20:38:35.000Z","fields":{"Last Name":"Goodrich","First Name":"Ray","Production Phase":"Live","Institution":"Fort Collins","College/Division":["Office of the Vice President for Research (OVPR)"],"en-StoryTitle":"Transfusion Medicine","Story Theme":"Health","Institutional/Program Stories":["recSYo8jT63xCEEGY"],"Grand Challenge":["Infectious Disease","COVID 19"],"Career Pathway ":["Biomedical Scientist"],"en-StoryMapLink":"https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/a1c2d0ccd8d9416fa60cac19d16562c0","Story Card Image":[{"id":"attNGHrIbF0A5hjsc","width":3916,"height":2204,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/58a1bc161776339978d40f24288c8bb2/306361d0/national-cancer-institute-egT3xtDu9DQ-unsplash1.jpg","filename":"national-cancer-institute-egT3xtDu9DQ-unsplash (1).jpg","size":1660270,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/4a0db647e37a71395f44457c1aa53498/45f9238d","width":64,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/92a15990dcaed9b6106ff3bf13cf7320/9303bf77","width":910,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/ec3428b42e1a2c253d8bab9f388d2922/2350dfb0","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Email":"ray.goodrich@colostate.edu","es-StoryTitle":"Medicina transfusional","QR Code":[{"id":"att5s1VDodHwv54BX","width":660,"height":660,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/f491c6c73f50c5a7afefc0dbf9b5dc3e/721c350e/QRCode43.png","filename":"QRCode (43).png","size":43898,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/00a34cc9296721a603f3d0a3afb67bb3/0e85aed4","width":36,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/b1a5a0e9655ca5e683fd9f8c8da115d8/edb1c731","width":512,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/61d5085cb5246a87baf6aa26a77fe646/7655248a","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Shortened CSU Branded URL":"https://col.st/UCDLF","Bilingual Translation":true,"Story Card Image Alt Text":"Image of blood collection tubes","Status":"Currently at CSU"}},{"id":"recnlVAOeO3gUMfEm","createdTime":"2021-08-29T20:38:35.000Z","fields":{"Last Name":"Kading","First Name":"Rebekah","Production Phase":"Live","Institution":"Fort Collins","College/Division":["College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences"],"Unit/Program":["Microbiology, Immunology, and Pathology"],"Research Focus":"Bat viruses & infectious disease ecology in Uganda","en-StoryTitle":"Viral Assemblages","Primary Story Content":"Bats, the only mammals with powered flight, are the second-most abundant order of mammals behind rodents and carry an equally impressive assemblage of viruses, many of which can make people sick.

Under the EPA’s recent Navigable Waters Protection Rule, streams classified as “ephemeral streams” — those which only flow briefly after rain or snowmelt — are not protected under the Clean Water Act. With fewer protections, more pollutants can be washed downstream — but some streams classified as ephemeral may actually be intermittent or seasonal, which would qualify them for protection. That’s where CSU professor Dr. Stephanie Kampf comes in. Dr. Kampf has been working for four years to map and define small headwater streams. Kampf and her team recently enlisted the help of the public through the Stream Tracker Project, an app that allows users to collect and submit their own data on nearby waterways.","Spatial Angle":"Ask researcher for maps of watersheds that they have created (maps mentioned in blurb)","LAT":" 41","LONG":"-105","Story Theme":"Water","Institutional/Program Stories":["recgh0HXJG2zMUgpR"],"Career Pathway ":["Hydrogeologist "],"SharePoint Folder":"https://colostate.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/CAS_Global_Mapping_and_Strategic_Outreach/EuX6FMniY5xNg_93M04GatEB4tWA4_W7DnTLVsZA6xHqRw?e=lz2hhQ","en-StoryMapLink":"https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/e18a8ca2cfd94f2784ea973cb30370f4","Story Card Image":[{"id":"attl6lfNjW4WRYVHf","width":1920,"height":1080,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/c1e97807c21941452015beb67588348e/79316de2/2_EphemeralStreams.jpg","filename":"2_EphemeralStreams.jpg","size":1226150,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/f1c20e48d5ad4e0c0832c1242230fe62/9ad2eadf","width":64,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/7fcfa7669df8d674ff84faea156545ba/d37281ba","width":910,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/498444f33230e8542abc109347e56f51/69012397","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Email":"stephanie.kampf@colostate.edu","es-StoryTitle":"Corrientes efímeras","QR Code":[{"id":"attRlm0vqHXemn4Gq","width":660,"height":660,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/10e1d8519d5d0465af9976d657a9600b/30d7b493/QRCode2.png","filename":"QRCode (2).png","size":43260,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/d3cdda947c8ef7dadabad6c3f75ecec7/f31d5c69","width":36,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/2f040181db4d6641f5408ea059199883/4566fcb9","width":512,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/3f7bbaeb4db02226a75502d355eaa852/5b5d5553","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Shortened CSU Branded URL":"https://col.st/6wS9L","Bilingual Translation":true,"Status":"Currently at CSU"}},{"id":"rectphgFIT8YrKKa2","createdTime":"2021-08-29T20:38:35.000Z","fields":{"Last Name":"Leach","First Name":"Jan","Production Phase":"Live","Institution":"Fort Collins","College/Division":["College of Agricultural Sciences"],"Unit/Program":["Agricultural Biology"],"Research Focus":"Plant Pathogens - China and the Philippines ","en-StoryTitle":"Revolutionizing Agriculture","Primary Story Content":"Dr. Jan Leach, associate dean for research and professor of Bioagricultural Sciences and Pest Management in the College of Agricultural Sciences at CSU, combats world hunger one grain of rice at a time.

His research at the NREL has extended across a broad array of interests, including invasive species, forestry, rare and endangered wildlife, ecosystem services, fire ecology, and climate change. His interests are frequently examined in the context of space and time through a suite of integrative spatial modeling techniques that combine field data, traditional and expert knowledge, geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing and spatial statistics. Such analytical approaches have been used for early detection of invasive species, discovery of new wildlife populations, mapping land-cover and critical habitats, and predicting species’ distribution in response to changing climates. Dr. Evangelista’s research spans a wide breadth of ecosystems, including semi-arid canyon lands of the American Southwest, coniferous forests of the Rocky Mountains, Afro-alpine communities of Ethiopia’s highlands, and marine systems of the Atlantic Ocean. His research is regularly coupled with non-traditional educational programs that aim to build capacity through experiential learning, applied science and stakeholder engagement. This is best demonstrated by his advisory role with the DEVELOP Program, part of NASA’s Applied Science Program, hosted by the NREL and the US Geological Survey. Ultimately, Dr. Evangelista’s broad research interests center on supporting sustainable management, stewardship and conservation of natural resources.","Spatial Angle":"Bale Mountains, Ethiopia","LAT":"12.286390","LONG":"39.673321","Story Theme":"Health","ID Tags":["Alumnus"],"Institutional/Program Stories":["recVXI3qT2R2M3umJ"],"Story Tags":["Sustainability/Biodiversity","Community Health","Conservation"],"Graduation Year":"1999, 2003, 2009","Degree":["BS","MS","PHD"],"Career Pathway ":["Ecologist"],"en-StoryMapLink":"https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/b7338c3cb9ca4e49bef0ae116fffc586","Story Card Image":[{"id":"attR7dEs1dkd2pcSI","width":1920,"height":1080,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/d9d3e225adeab127f7e456c84397fde0/28ed415e/erik-hathaway-eRFC0_U0hGE-unsplash1.jpg","filename":"erik-hathaway-eRFC0_U0hGE-unsplash (1).jpg","size":1033379,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/65b7e324a5acb7c4e6813b41a81d9cc4/a3fd3f8e","width":64,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/3497861079e8836716092c62df25b44e/a6474cf0","width":910,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/45d214475e33d9ea6b0ee837f0f1452e/a99e4a1c","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Email":"Paul.Evangelista@colostate.edu","es-StoryTitle":"Medicina tradicional de plantas","QR Code":[{"id":"attmI4TYX7ciPsDMx","width":660,"height":660,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/fd713f829ac8183aa4567b27a56656e9/35750c86/QRCode30.png","filename":"QRCode (30).png","size":43843,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/814769f9e09d6f846a195b29c11da72f/4b58d36b","width":36,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/05360d80b088ce9f317030ff6e21730c/cf25ab51","width":512,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/233b74d9b3899b0014213609ba9f63fb/d5677d1c","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Shortened CSU Branded URL":"https://col.st/ubMjp","Bilingual Translation":true,"Story Card Image Alt Text":"Image of a lush green valley","Status":"Currently at CSU"}},{"id":"reckaI6NwN7FMIUbb","createdTime":"2021-08-29T20:38:35.000Z","fields":{"Last Name":"Gaines","First Name":"Todd","Production Phase":"Live","Institution":"Fort Collins","College/Division":["College of Agricultural Sciences"],"Unit/Program":["Agricultural Biology"],"Research Focus":"Harnessing Next-Generation Sequencing Technologies for Eco-Evolutionary Studies of Herbicide Resistance and Weed Biology","en-StoryTitle":"Crop Protection","Spatial Angle":"Herbicide use in the country","LAT":"40.46737","LONG":"-97.32517","Story Theme":"Food","ID Tags":["Alumnus"],"Institutional/Program Stories":["recQCiv7n0YhrDl65"],"Graduation Year":"2004, 2006, 2009","Degree":["BS","MS","PHD"],"Career Pathway ":["Geneticist"],"en-StoryMapLink":"https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/81fa4cc7ca234130a6d8df49fd1cac3b","Story Card Image":[{"id":"atttPTBiFuIlZXMAR","width":2612,"height":1468,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/b37bbcddeca86232ff09a013ae8e67c9/347414ea/wheat.jpg","filename":"wheat.jpg","size":1330932,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/19abd54208cfb55f62a5dab5a1098bcd/cb793423","width":64,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/d017f17008db8d1d68c23e4277b05a9d/e401bc77","width":911,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/abc1efc605a4765be63dc9cc51ba7388/1464896f","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Email":"todd.gaines@colostate.edu","es-StoryTitle":"Protección de cultivos","QR Code":[{"id":"att2stzGxssdRE9Bl","width":660,"height":660,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/8727a763637bc4c8b31c484965c0e5fb/254ca580/QRCode41.png","filename":"QRCode (41).png","size":44118,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/70fe02861faa86f44c480b8e1f5c0e26/45c55e98","width":36,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/a1dc4fbba1afa0b2cfaa9f21e97d501e/baff6d78","width":512,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/6831aea3ae882e00efef0873a130703f/4df18b91","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Shortened CSU Branded URL":"https://col.st/V7Brj","Bilingual Translation":true,"Story Card Image Alt Text":"Image of golden wheat crops","Status":"Currently at CSU"}},{"id":"recVWgo81pGpAONfe","createdTime":"2021-08-29T20:38:35.000Z","fields":{"Last Name":"Galvin","First Name":"Kathleen","Production Phase":"Live","Institution":"Fort Collins","College/Division":["College of Liberal Arts"],"Unit/Program":["Anthropology and Geography"],"Research Focus":"Human Environment Interactions -

Listening to the Maasai share knowledge of climate change and the challenges it creates in their daily lives, Galvin also brings them together in a conversation with scientists and civil leaders to better understand the real human impacts of climate change on this vulnerable population.","Spatial Angle":"Kenya on a map of Africa","LAT":"-1.28638","LONG":"36.81722","Story Theme":"Environment","ID Tags":["Alumnus"],"Institutional/Program Stories":["rec0scLExpYcBzVhl","recVXI3qT2R2M3umJ"],"Grand Challenge":["Climate Change"],"Degree":["BA","MA"],"Career Pathway ":["Anthropologist"],"SharePoint Folder":"https://colostate.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/CAS_Global_Mapping_and_Strategic_Outreach/EljsFOehMRhNimnglhG1THsBjUBNY9q5s0olmKU5Mwlu9A?e=qd5roL","en-StoryMapLink":"https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/a9ee32cb6bd4466ab8366aa24fb7da19","Story Card Image":[{"id":"atte7STKVb77QPb1n","width":1920,"height":1080,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/4732a22a4768ae2327826e13b97dff07/c3dafd9f/ian-macharia-NRv8BsouFBQ-unsplash11.jpg","filename":"ian-macharia-NRv8BsouFBQ-unsplash (1) (1).jpg","size":576403,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/96f93170286132dfcc62f04e4de09973/5d362faf","width":64,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/4c8e9dc817971cbd8c98acb4bb12f198/9e741006","width":910,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/995d291e3a76113ab0200093b1554a11/05532938","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Email":"kathleen.galvin@colostate.edu","es-StoryTitle":"Escuchando el pastoralismo","QR Code":[{"id":"attjEWO60tEMrOZMq","width":660,"height":660,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/92968c9fe534212f45b67a70386f0f9c/6b0e5f58/QRCode10.png","filename":"QRCode (10).png","size":43603,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/9aa4af70a4bbbe7ed24b329b2b1cbd33/9659f114","width":36,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/5fdf2829719246cca10fea506f7fb2e7/30bb506f","width":512,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/a5ef52f5370f1d6dbaacac3a33320718/eb3ae61d","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Shortened CSU Branded URL":"https://col.st/I8t9A","Bilingual Translation":true,"Status":"Currently at CSU"}},{"id":"recRGYcCPAoTX0nxO","createdTime":"2021-08-29T20:38:35.000Z","fields":{"Last Name":"Gates","First Name":"Timothy","Production Phase":"Live","Institution":"Fort Collins","College/Division":["Walter Scott, Jr. College of Engineering"],"Unit/Program":["Civil and Environmental Engineering"],"Research Focus":"USAID project in water resources with Pakistan;

While the exact mechanisms aren\'t fully understood, prions -- misfolded proteins -- cause neurons to degenerate by forming plaques in the central nervous system. As neurons die, holes are formed in the brain and other neural tissue, leading to dramatic weight loss, listlessness, trouble walking, and eventually death. While there has never been a reported case of CWD in humans, a jump to humans is not outside of the realm of possibility. And humans already experience other protein-misfolding diseases such as Alzheimer\'s, Parkinson\'s, and diabetes. CSU\'s Candace Mathiason is a leading researcher in the area of prions -- while working on her Ph.D., she demonstrated for the first time that prions are carried in bodily fluids and can be transmitted without direct bodily contact -- and hopes that her research into mechanisms of transmission can shed light on not just CWD, but a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases.

His areas of interest include satellite-based remote sensing of the Earth/atmosphere system from a wide assortment of sensor technologies including active/passive systems spanning the optical to microwave portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. From 2000 to 2007, he worked at the Naval Research Laboratory in Monterey, CA in the Satellite Meteorological Applications Section, where he developed numerous value-added satellite imagery tools for operational users (including mineral dust, snow cover, cloud optical properties, low cloud/fog, fire, thin cirrus, deep convection, natural color, contrail, volcanic ash, and nighttime low-light applications). His mineral dust detection algorithms for MODIS and SeaWiFS were among the first to exploit blue-band absorption properties. In 2005, Dr. Miller published the first satellite detection of a widespread bioluminescence phenomenon (the ‘Milky Sea’) using the DSMP Operational Linescan System.  This was followed in 2021 by new detections by the next-generation Day/Night Band low-light sensor. Dr. Miller joined CIRA in 2007 as a Research Scientist and Deputy Director. In 2021 he joined the Faculty of CSU’s Department of Atmospheric Science, where he serves as Professor and Director of CIRA.  He continues work in developing satellite techniques geared toward operational end-users.","en-StoryTitle":"Chasing the Light","Spatial Angle":"Atmospheric Science/ Milky Seas - Indian Ocean","LAT":"33.137550","LONG":"81.826172","Story Theme":"Environment","ID Tags":["Alumnus"],"Institutional/Program Stories":["recmfw9UFACO660S8"],"Graduation Year":"1997, 2000","Degree":["MS","PHD"],"Career Pathway ":["Atmospheric Scientist"],"en-StoryMapLink":"https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/10cb0bbf5afb44148f6a908929105547","Story Card Image":[{"id":"attQ9vQE23XrA11fJ","width":1398,"height":787,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/88578cf9c6befea9987efbf27ce58e35/c8532fa4/header-milky-seas-2048x983.jpg","filename":"header-milky-seas-2048x983.jpg","size":275038,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/db626bbfbb388e3c5d7d0a785d162ce3/a41eb64f","width":64,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/ef155d1e522bd56a1b16ec6fd5b742e3/9561235b","width":909,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/ae763da2c175f2a624fe7cd85aece0df/e9d49626","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Email":"steven.miller@colostate.edu","es-StoryTitle":"Persiguiendo la luz","QR Code":[{"id":"attzBG9b3dVF7cH97","width":660,"height":660,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/7965b6cde605968b2c1b1a948322a6a8/7a141922/QRCode51.png","filename":"QRCode (51).png","size":43415,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/59708cffc1e20e9614f13a1cc979f6e2/89274377","width":36,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/f65b44793da95ae2416297f70a28e817/1ab64624","width":512,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/63ed959475761eb08fea2f961ce819d0/81bb91ce","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Shortened CSU Branded URL":"https://col.st/vtWmJ","Bilingual Translation":true,"Story Card Image Alt Text":"Illustration of a boat over a milky sky ocean","Status":"Currently at CSU"}},{"id":"recoFoAb35aKNL0fK","createdTime":"2021-08-29T20:38:35.000Z","fields":{"Last Name":"Orton","First Name":"Chris","Production Phase":"Live","Institution":"Fort Collins","College/Division":["College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences"],"Unit/Program":["Clinical Sciences"],"en-StoryTitle":"Canine Cardiology","Spatial Angle":"traveled to China to meet with leaders from the Shanghai Hanyu Medical Technology Company","LAT":"31.230391","LONG":"121.473701","Story Theme":"Health","ID Tags":["Alumnus"],"Graduation Year":"1989","Degree":["PHD"],"Career Pathway ":["Veterinarian"],"en-StoryMapLink":"https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/cee3d05107184956a356fd8bca16f38b","Story Card Image":[{"id":"attSzqYWe11ZKAf4f","width":2918,"height":1642,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/425024fa5808391cd8e20048d8220a6c/5e3854cd/ryan-walton-uKtvYMGe8ls-unsplash1.jpg","filename":"ryan-walton-uKtvYMGe8ls-unsplash (1).jpg","size":904622,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/dab7ba2095fcb3c5e89b13aac690f1d4/2f5206c7","width":64,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/18b8cada776c8e994f0307339cb95688/93990d5f","width":910,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/8946c57a6e48fc42655be4ae16a63c48/02aae641","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Email":"chris.orton@colostate.edu","es-StoryTitle":"Cardiología canina","QR Code":[{"id":"attarWXio98cM8AaF","width":660,"height":660,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/daf19cd4affff349d82aa1d583dfb544/8d104943/QRCode53.png","filename":"QRCode (53).png","size":43857,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/e5e6b59ebc39ee47121a454973187f8f/8fdcb4f5","width":36,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/4a4e729faa1ec64a8a83df18b6b571b1/b09df13e","width":512,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/1c6579fbb02ecc472930356c8a21795d/9ff20263","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Shortened CSU Branded URL":"https://col.st/QaIlg","Bilingual Translation":true,"Story Card Image Alt Text":"Close up view of a dog looking at the camera","Status":"Currently at CSU"}},{"id":"recPhU5CosdMcxj6U","createdTime":"2021-08-29T20:38:35.000Z","fields":{"Last Name":"Reid","First Name":"Robin","Production Phase":"Live","Institution":"Fort Collins","College/Division":["Warner College of Natural Resources"],"Unit/Program":["Ecosystem Science and Sustainability"],"Research Focus":"Social Ecological Systems in Africa","en-StoryTitle":"Collaborative Conservation","Primary Story Content":"CSU Professor Robin Reid works with people in Kenya, Mongolia, and Colorado, applying science to help them address issues that matter most to their communities.
