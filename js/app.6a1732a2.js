In Burkina Faso, nearly every single person has malaria parasites in his or her system during the rainy season, and children can get the disease repeatedly before they develop immunity. Dr. Brian Foy, a professor in the Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Pathology at CSU, found that the use of Ivermectin, typically used to treat parasitic worms, led to a significant reduction in cases of malaria among children under the age of five.

Dr. VandeWoude is currently on a Fulbright sabbatical studying wildlife disease ecology in Tasmania.","Blurb Author":"EKA","Centroid Mapper":"Mary Williams (2021-2022)","LAT":" 27","LONG":"-81","Story Theme":"Health","Institutional/Program Stories":["recPQTwK0Bc7NsocO","rec0scLExpYcBzVhl"],"Production Round":"Round 1","Grand Challenge":["Infectious Disease"],"Story Assets":["TBD"],"Start date":"2021-07-01","End date":"2021-10-01","Career Pathway ":["Veterinarian","Virologist "],"SharePoint Folder":"https://colostate.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/CAS_Global_Mapping_and_Strategic_Outreach/EhE_UDsdjvFMkrjcBZWTjwABvlQqz_zg31jBTV60cBmKcQ?e=eFKuMG","en-StoryMapLink":"https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/1ae6356047b143ae927111e9e4f3fed0","Story Card Image":[{"id":"attfmb680C5FMQCad","width":900,"height":600,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/59b19cc5c366d65b24f5401f31791898/41aeb471/16_FelineInfections.jpg","filename":"16_FelineInfections.jpg","size":419750,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/bff986fb5fc493ff0f1a41bbf096e461/4f7f582f","width":54,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/bb3709965d57318096eea7fb7d909794/526458d6","width":768,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/095e794aac08986fa9d17891aa1a06b5/4f84fe6a","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"en-PopUpCardContent":"All cats — domestic and wild — can become infected with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), resulting in a disease process comparable to HIV in humans.
